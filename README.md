`planktonr` is an r package that facilitates the download, analysis and
visualisation of phytoplankton and zooplankton data. Our initial focus
will be on plankton data stored on the Australian Ocean Data Network
([AODN](https://portal.aodn.org.au)) and collected by the Integrated
Marine Observing System ([IMOS](www.imos.org.au)), but we hope to expand
to other plankton data sets in the future.

## Installation

We are currently not on CRAN (hopefully soon). Be aware that this
package is in the very early stages of development. Functions and
documentation are not complete so installing at the moment is at your
own risk. If you are still interested, you can install the development
version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PlanktonTeam/planktonr")
```

Thanks to the team at the Integration and Application Network
(ian.umces.edu/media-library) for the copepod symbol used in the
planktonr logo.
