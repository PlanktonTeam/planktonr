\title{Import NRS Station information}
\usage{
pr_get_Stations(Survey = "NRS")
}
\arguments{
\item{Survey}{Survey type:
\itemize{
\item \code{"NRS"} - National Reference Stations (default) - includes all active and
discontinued coastal monitoring stations
\item \code{"SOTS"} - Southern Ocean Time Series mooring site south of Tasmania
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with station information including:
\itemize{
\item \code{StationCode} - Three-letter station code
\item \code{StationName} - Full station name
\item \code{Latitude}, \code{Longitude} - Geographic coordinates
\item \code{StationStartDate} - Date sampling commenced
\item Additional metadata about sampling schedule and location
}
}
\description{
Load station metadata including station codes, names, geographic coordinates,
and sampling schedules for National Reference Stations and Southern Ocean
Time Series sites.
}
\details{
The National Reference Stations (NRS) network consists of coastal mooring sites
around Australia. Most stations sample monthly, though Darwin samples quarterly
and some stations have discontinued sampling. The returned dataframe includes
station start dates, sampling frequencies, and geographic information.

Station codes include: DAR (Darwin), YON (Yongala), NSI (North Stradbroke Island),
PHB (Port Hacking), MAI (Maria Island), ROT (Rottnest Island), ESP (Esperance),
NIN (Ningaloo), and KAI (Kangaroo Island).
