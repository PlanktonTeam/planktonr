\title{Get CPR sampling trip metadata}
\usage{
pr_get_CPRTrips(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional variables passed to \code{\link[=pr_add_Bioregions]{pr_add_Bioregions()}}. Currently supports:
\itemize{
\item \code{near_dist_km} - Distance in kilometres to pad bioregion boundaries when
assigning samples to regions (default behaviour uses exact boundaries)
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with CPR trip information including:
\itemize{
\item \code{TripCode} - Unique trip identifier
\item \code{SampleTime_Local} - Local sampling date and time
\item \code{Year_Local}, \code{Month_Local} - Temporal components
\item \code{Latitude}, \code{Longitude} - Geographic coordinates
\item \code{BioRegion} - Australian marine bioregion assignment
\item Additional metadata fields
}
}
\description{
Load metadata for all Continuous Plankton Recorder sampling trips, including
dates, locations, and bioregion assignments. Each trip represents a tow
segment sampled by the CPR.
}
\details{
The CPR samples continuously as it is towed behind ships of opportunity. Each
"trip" in this context represents a segment of the tow, typically covering
approximately 3 nautical miles.

Samples are automatically assigned to Australian marine bioregions using
\code{\link[=pr_add_Bioregions]{pr_add_Bioregions()}}. Bioregions include: Temperate East, South-east,
South-west, North, and North-west.
}
\examples{
# Get all CPR trips with default bioregion assignment
df <- pr_get_CPRTrips()

# Get CPR trips with expanded bioregion boundaries (250 km padding)
df <- pr_get_CPRTrips(near_dist_km = 250)

# Examine sampling effort by bioregion and year
table(df$BioRegion, df$Year_Local)
