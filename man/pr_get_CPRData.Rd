\usage{
pr_get_CPRData(Type = "Phytoplankton", Variable = "abundance", Subset = "raw")
}
\arguments{
\item{Type}{The data of interest: \code{"Phytoplankton"} or \code{"Zooplankton"}}

\item{Variable}{Variable options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"abundance"} - Cell or individual counts (available for both phytoplankton and zooplankton)
\item \code{"biovolume"} - Cell biovolume in cubic micrometres (phytoplankton only)
}}

\item{Subset}{Data compilation level:
\itemize{
\item \code{"raw"} - Raw taxonomic data as identified by analysts
\item \code{"htg"} - Higher taxonomic groups (e.g., diatoms, dinoflagellates, copepods)
\item \code{"genus"} - Data aggregated to genus level
\item \code{"species"} - Data aggregated to species level
\item \code{"copepods"} - Copepod data only (zooplankton only)
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with requested plankton data in long form. Each row represents
a taxon observation in a sample, with columns for metadata (location, date, time)
and abundance or biovolume values.
}
\description{
Load Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) plankton data from the Integrated Marine
Observing System (IMOS). The CPR is a high-speed plankton sampler that is towed
behind ships of opportunity at approximately 10 metres depth. Samples are collected
continuously along transects, providing broad-scale spatial coverage.
}
\details{
The CPR samples plankton organisms in the 200-500 micrometre size range. Unlike
NRS data which are point samples, CPR data represent integrated samples over
approximately 3 nautical miles. The data are returned in long format.

CPR sampling occurs both day and night as ships operate continuously. Consider
using \code{\link[=pr_get_DayNight]{pr_get_DayNight()}} to examine diel patterns in the data.

Note: Biovolume data is only available for phytoplankton.

# Get raw phytoplankton abundance data
df <- pr_get_CPRData(Type = "Phytoplankton", Variable = "abundance", Subset = "raw")

# Get zooplankton data at species level
df <- pr_get_CPRData(Type = "Zooplankton", Variable = "abundance", Subset = "species")

# Get higher taxonomic group data
df <- pr_get_CPRData(Type = "Phytoplankton", Variable = "abundance", Subset = "htg")
